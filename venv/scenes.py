	1:'''You see everyone crowded in a room. Phyllis is visabliy upset. Toby is concerned and Michael is standing there with his hand tucked in his pants and index finger poking out of his zipper.
		He looks at you and says "Hey Creed, hows it hangin?" You decide it's funny, and hang some brain as well. You walk over to Michael and try to sword fight, but he runs away crying.''',
	2:'''You notice Pam has her glasses on. You wonder if she's blind. A lot of your favorite jazz cats are blind. You then get the urge to see if she can play the piano, so you go online and order a piano.
		The piano is delivered to the office at lunch time. You see this and strike up a conversation with Pam and excitedly exclaim "JAZZ SHOW! JAZZ SHOW! JAZZ SHOW AT LUNCH!" You also tell Pam you'd like to see her topless''',
	3:'''You walk into the break room and see Ryan and Kelly doing a mixture of fighting and kissing. Kelly goes on and on about how she's with Darryl. Ryan types a breakup text for her to send to Darryl. She does.
		It works, Kelly is excited, Ryan is confused. You decide to take this chance and interject. Ryan is the hottest in the office, and Kelly reminds you of your time in Bangledesh. Next thing you know, you three are
		in a polyamorous relationship and headed to Pochonos this weekend.''',
	4:'''You are trying trying to beat a game of solitare when you look up and see Kevin and Oscar running around the office with boxes of paper strapped to your feet. This reminds you of your time spent in Iceland during 
		the Cold War and a popular sport they used to play called Flonkerton. You decide to grab a couple boxes and jump into the race. Next thing you know, the reciptionest is handing you tops to yougurt containers 
		connected to strings and saying they are olympic medals. "What is wrong with this woman" you wonder. She is always doing quirky stuff, but you take the medals to be nice.''',
	5:'''You spend a late night at one of your favorite underground clubs in town where people usually dress up in costumes. You wake up late for work, still messed up and in costume. You forget where you are and say
		"Want to see a magic trick?" In walks Kevin, dressed as the joker from batman. He looks at you and says "Dammit Creed, I've been up since 4!" You are unsure what he's talking about when it hits you, you and him are
		dressed in the same costume, though yours is from your furry night, and his is from Batman''',
	6:'''You are in the bathroom in the office and you hear music coming from downstairs. You decide to head down and you see there is a cafe disco going on. This reminds you of your days in Morrocco and you feel
		like an acid flashback coming on, but that's unlikely. Anyways you decide to bust out some	moves and next thing you know, you wake up locked inside a fridge at Vance Refrigeration''',
	7:'''You head down to the quarry with a package to throw down there. You notice Jim hanging out, throwing rocks into the quarry. You try to run away but he spots you and say's you guys had a time to meet here and throw
		things down there. You try to play it cool so he doesn't see what's in the package. And he does. Even though he is gay, you try and hook him up with your daugther, but he declines. Finally he leaves and you are
		able to throw your package in the quarry''',
	8:'''As Michael is going around introducing the temp to people, you see that Dwight has a mound of jello on his desk. You realize you forgot your lunch so you sneak over when no one is looking and grab the plate of jello. 
		for some reason there is a stapler in the jell-o, and you don't even know how to use one of those so you just throw it in the trash''',
	9:'''For some reason Jim is running red wire from Dwights computer to the light pole outside. Dwight seems irritated by it, and you honestly have no idea why. Dwight goes outside to climb the pole, and that's when you 
		swoop in to claim the wire for yourself.''',
	10:'''You are taking Karate classes online'''
